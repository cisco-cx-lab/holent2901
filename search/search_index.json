            "text": "Lab 1: Advanced Routing\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will help ACME on advanced routing using local and central policy. You will perform the following tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACME DC routers have already tagged all the routes originated from DC1 with BGP community of 65010:1000; all the routes originated from DC2 with BGP community of 65020:2000. \nPlease configure a route-policy to ensure default route (0.0.0.0/0) coming from DC to set an OMP tag of 100.\n For DC1 routes, setting an OMP tag of \n1000\n; for DC2 routes, setting an OMP tag of \n2000\n. (Lab_Task 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACME wants to have a \nhub & spoke topology between Remotes and DCs as well between Remotes and Regional hubs\n. Hub & spoke topology will scale more by reducing NO. of tunnels required on the devices. (Lab_Task 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACME has categorized their branches into multiple Business Units(BUs). In the Data Center (DC) sites, the headend WAN Edges(WEs) are also categorized into multiple BUs for horizontal scaling purpose in terms of throughputs, therefore remote site only needs to build tunnels to its respective DC hub WEs. \nRemote Site1 only needs to build tunnels to DC1-WE1 and DC2-WE2\n; on the contrary, \nRemote Site 2 only needs to build tunnels to DC1-WE2 and DC2-WE2\n.(Lab_Task 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemote sites receive default route from both RH and DC, \nDCs will be preferred and load shared\n. If RH goes down, DCs are load shared for default(Lab_Task 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchange to \n- Remote sites receive default route from both RH and DC, \nDCs will be preferred and load shared. RH's default will be used as backup for DCs. (Lab_Task 3)**\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemotes sites receive more specific routes from both DCs, \nroutes originated from local DC are preferred\n, if one DC goes down, it will use the routes from another DC as backup. In another words, from remote sites perspective, previously routes tagged with 1000 will prefer DC1; routes tagged with 2000 will prefer DC2.(Lab_Task 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor remote sites to any other regional routes are forced to go through DC\u2019s functional hub. For \nremote site1, it goes through WE1 in DC1 and DC2\n; for \nremote site 2, it goes through WE2 in DC1 and DC2\n.(Lab_Task 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: In these lab exercises, it's possible that there are multiple ways to achieve the requirements. The lab guide provides a detailed step by step instruction for each taks. However you're welcomed to solve it with your own solution. Just be mindful with the time.\n\n\nTask 1: Local Route Policy\n\n\nStep 1.1\n Verification of the routes received on DC WEs.\n\n\n\n\nSSH to \nDC1-WE1\n (repeat the same on DC1-WE2,DC2-WE1,DC2-WE2,R1-WE1 and R2-WE2 as well) and do \nshow ip route vrf 1\n and make sure \n10.100.100.0/24, 10.200.200/24\n as well as \n0.0.0.0/0\n learned via BGP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1.2\n Verify the BGP communities.\n\n\n\n\n10.100.100.0/24 should tag with 65010:1000; 10.200.200.0/24 should tag with 65020:2000. Execute \nshow ip bgp vpnv4 vrf 1 <prefix>\n (10.100.100.0/24 and 10.200.200.0/24) on DC1-WE1,WE2 and DC2-WE1,WE2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1.3\n set OMP tag for DC specific Routes\n\n\n\n\nlogin vManage \n198.18.133.200\n and access policy configuration from \nConfiguration - Policies\n\n\nClick \nCustom Options\n drop down on the top right and select \nRoute Policy\n under \nLocalized Policy\n\n\n\n\nClick \nAdd Route Policy\n to Create new\n\n\n\n\nName: \nLAB_DCs_BGP_RP\n  (write down this name, it will be used later)\n\n\nDescription: \nLAB_DCs_BGP_RP\n\n\nClick \n+Sequence Type\n on the left then click \n+Sequence Rule\n, click Match, select \nAddress\n, select \ndefault\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nAction\n, change to \nAccept\n, then select OMP tag, key in \n100\n, then save Match and Actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclick \nSequence Rule\n to create following two rules:\n\n\n\n\nMatch \ncommunity-list DC1_Routes\n, \nAccept\n and Set \nTag 1000\n\n\nMatch \ncommunity-list DC2_Routes\n, \nAccept\n and Set \nTag 2000\n  \n\n\nThen click on Save Route Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1.4\n Creating a Local Policy\n\n\n\n\nlogin vManage \n198.18.133.200\n and access policy configuration from \nConfiguration - Policies\n\n\nClick on \nLocalized Policy\n, then click on \nAdd Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on Next to proceed till you see \nConfigure Route Policy\n; click \nAdd Route Policy\n then select \nImport Existing Policy\n; Select \nLAB_DCs_BGP_RP\n click import\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on Next, Key in\n\n\nPolicy Name: \nLAB_DCs_Local_policy\n\n\nPolicy Description: \nLAB_DCs_Local_policy\n .\n\n\nCheck \nNetflow, Application\n and \nImplicit ACL Logging\n.\n\n\nThen click on Save Policy (Feel free to click Preview before save)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1.5\n apply the route-policy\n\n\n\n\nAccess feature template configuration from \nConfiguration - Templates - Feature\n\n\nLocate feture template \nLab_DC_VPN1_BGP_V01\n and select three dots then click \nEdit\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect \nNeighbor\n section, then click on the pencil icon under Action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the following:\n\n\nAddress Family\n changes to Global and set to \nOn\n\n\nAddress Family\n changes to Global and set to \nipv4-unicast\n\n\nRoute Policy In\n changes to Global and set to \nOn\n\n\nPolicy Name\n changes to Global and set to \nLAB_DCs_BGP_RP\n (this was the name you wrote down earlier)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthen click on Save changes and Click on Update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen click Next, feel free to review the config changes, then click Configure Devices, then check the Confirm configuration box and click on OK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1.6\n Verify OMP Tags\n\n\n\n\nSSH to DC wEdge routers(\nDC1-WE1,DC1-WE2,DC2-WE1,DC2-WE2\n) and run \nshow ip bgp vpnv4 vrf 1 <prefix>\n (10.100.100.0/24,10.200.200.0/24), you should see proper OMP tags are set\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 2: Hub & Spoke Topologies\n\n\nStep 2.1.\n Pre-config verifications\n\n\n\n\nSSH to \nR1-WE1\n and do \nshow sdwan omp route vpn 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Do you know why the default route learned from private2 shown as invalid and unreachable (Inv,U)\n? \n\n\nThis is because R1-WE1 doesn't have a transport with private 2 color. If you watch the route on R2-WE1, you should notice the next hop from private 1 marked as \n(Inv,U)\n for the same reason where private 1 color doesn't exist on R2-WE1.\n\n\nQuestion: Did you notice the default route is learned from 1.1.30.2 which is the Regional Hub(RH)? Do you know why?\n \n\n\nTo answer this question, we will check the route table at vSmart as all the routes are advertised by vSmart. SSH to vSmart and do \nshow omp route vpn 1 0.0.0.0/0 detail | t\n\n\n\n\nOMP is very much like BGP when it comes down to route preference. In the order of preference, there is a origin-protocol, in this case the default route learned on RH is from Static (by design, in real deployment, probably it's going to be BGP as well); whereas the default learned from DCs is from iBGP. Origin protocol static is more preferred than iBGP.\n\n\nNow, let's look at the specific routes learned from DC. Do \nshow sdwan omp route vpn 1 10.100.100.0/24\n on vSmart.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: you will see 4 paths and one of the paths shows Inv,U. Hopefully you can answer why it's that. But why there are 4 paths?\n\n\nLet's SSH to vSmart and do \nshow omp route vpn 1 10.100.100.0/24 | t\n.\n\n\n\n\nYou will see 12 ECMP routes marked as \nC,R\n (Chosen,Resolved). Why 12? Because we have 4 DC wEdges each with 3 transports, so total 12 paths. \n\n\nThe next question will be why there are only 4 paths on the remote wEdges? This is because the ECMP settings on the wEdge by default is set to 4. If you change it to 16 (currently 16, it will be increased to 128 in the future release), you will see all 12 paths. \n\n\nNote: vSmart randomly selects 4 paths (or whatever the max ECMP value is set) and install on the device. In a  large deployment where multiple paths is more than 16 (before 128 paths is supported), this may pose problem.\n\n\nIn this exercise we purposely keep the default ECMP setting and learn how to solve this issue with centralized policy.\n\n\nStep 2.2.\n Create a topology for centralized policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlogin vManage \n198.18.133.200\n and access policy configuration from \nConfiguration - Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nCustom Options\n drop down on the top right and select \nTopology\n under \nCentralized Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nAdd Topology\n under \nTopology\n and select \nCustom Control( Route&TLOC )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are going to create two topologies, one for each remote site.\n- Create topology policy for Remote1\n    - Name: \nLAB_Topo_RS1\n\n    - Description: \nLAB topology for Remote Site 1\n\n    - Click \n+Sequence Type\n and select \nRoute\n\n    - Click \n+Sequence Rule\n, leave unchanged under Match(means match all)\n    - Click \nActions\n and change to \nAccept\n (we'll come back and do the routes policy later).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclick \n+Sequence Type\n then select \nTLOC\n\n\nclick \n+Sequence Rule\n, select \nTLOC\n.\n\n\nUnder \nMatch Conditions\n, selects \nDCs-BU1-TLOCs\n for \nTLOC List\n (this TLOC list has been pre-defined for you which includes all the TLOCs of DC1-WE1 and DC2-WE1\n\n\nClick \nActions\n, change Actions to \nAccept\n\n\nClick \n+Sequence Rule\n, select \nTLOC\n\n\nunder \nMatch Conditions\n, selects \nRH\n for \nTLOC List\n (this TLOC list has been pre-defined for you which includes all the TLOCs of RH)\n\n\nClick \nActions\n, change Actions to \nAccept\n\n\nThen click save Control Policy.\n\n\n\n\nThis policy effectively allows R1-WE1 to build tunnels to all the DCs-BU1 devices (DC1-WE1 and DC2-WE1) as well as RH, nothing else as the default action is reject.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the above steps and create another topology for Remote2 with the following settings:\n\n\nName: \nLAB_Topo_RS2\n\n\nDescription: \nLAB topology for Remote Site 2\n\n\nClick \n+Sequence Type\n then select \nRoute\n\n\nClick \n+Sequence Rule\n, leave unchanged under Match(means match all),\n\n\nClick \nActions\n change Actions to \nAccept\n (we'll come back and do the routes policy later).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Click **+Sequence Type** then select **TLOC**\n- click **+Sequence Rule**, select **TLOC**.\n- Under **Match Conditions**, selects **DCs-BU2-TLOCss** for **TLOC List** (this TLOC list has been pre-defined for you which includes all the TLOCs of DC1-WE2 and DC2-WE2)\n- Click **Actions**, change Actions to **Accept**\n- Click **+Sequence Rule**, select **TLOC**\n- under **Match Conditions**, selects **RH** for **TLOC List** (this TLOC list has been pre-defined for you which includes all the TLOCs of RH)\n- Click **Actions**, change Actions to **Accept**\n\n\n\n\n\nThen click save Control Policy.\n\n\n\n\nThis policy effectively allows R2-WE1 to build tunnels to all the DCs-BU1 devices (DC1-WE2 and DC2-WE2) as well as RH, nothing else as the default action is reject.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2.3.\n Apply the topology policy to Centralized Policy\n\n\n\n\nlogin vManage \n198.18.133.200\n and access policy configuration from \nConfiguration - Policies\n\n\nClick \nAdd Policy\n under \nCentralized Policy\n\n\nClick next, you will see Configure Topology and VPN membership - Click \nAdd topology\n, select \nImport Existing Topology\n\n\nClick \nCustom Control(Route and TLOC)\n, select \nLAB_Topo_RS1\n\n\nClick on Add Topology\n\n\nfollow the above steps to add topology \nLAB_Topo_RS2\n as well\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nNext\n proceed to the last step for Applying Policies to Sites and VPNs\n\n\nPolicy Name: \nLAB_Central_v01\n\n\nDescription: \nTask2 Topo only\n\n\nClick New Site List Under \nLAB_Topo_RS1\n, under \nOutbound Site List\n, select \nRS1\n,then click on Add\n\n\nClick New Site List Under \nLAB_Topo_RS2\n, under \nOutbound Site List\n, select \nRS2\n,then click on Add\nthen click Save Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2.4.\n Activate the first Centralized Policy\n\n\n\n\nlogin vManage \n198.18.133.200\n and access policy configuration from \nConfiguration - Policies - Centralized Policy\n\n\nlocate policy \nLAB_Centeral_v01\n you have created in previous step.

However, the output shows the routes are not changed at all, the three installed routes still learned from RH and no preference set either. Why is that?\n\n\n\n\nLet's check omp route table on the vSmart, SSH to vSmart and do \nshow omp route | t\n. As you recall, the OMP routes don't have any changes either where 3 paths learned from RH marked with C,R due to routes originated from Static which are preferred over originated from iBGP. But why the outbound policy setting the routes originated from DC1-WE1 and DC2-WE1 doesn't work, \nthis is because outbound policy will only look for the chosen routes with C.R by default, other routes without learned from DCs as they are not chosen without C,R\n, so those routes are not even going through the outbound policies. There are multiple way of changing this behavior such as using inbound policy or configure send-backup path, or make every route with C.R. We're not going over all the solutions.\n\n\nLet's configure an vSmart \ninbound policy\n to make the default routes from DCs have higher OMP preference than RH's.\n\n\nNote: vSmart inbound policy may not be an ideal solution for the scenarios.

Dragging the new rule up and drop the rule in front of the accept all rule (if you follow the lab previously, the new rules should be No. 5, 6,7 and 8, match all rule should be rule No. 9), Then click Save policy and Activate. This will make the vSmart to push the policy immediately after you confirm configuring devices (this is expected as illuted earlier, creating a new policy is a best practice otherwise upating the existing policy will cause the immediate policy push. )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's verify. SSH to R1-WE1 and do show sdwan omp route vpn 1, you can see 4 paths for 10.100.100.0/24, however we see 3 paths with preference of 100, 1 path doesn't have preference; and for 10.200.200.0/24, there are 4 paths however 3 paths with preference of 50, 1 path doesn't have preference. If you look at it closely you will notice that the paths picked are from the lowest system-ip.\n\n\n\n\nThis is caused that vSmart by default will only send 4 paths to the wEdges. When vSmart is going through the outbound policy, it takes a route from vsmart route table in the winning order (marked as C,R) and compare it with the outbound policy as long as there is a match (permit) in the policy for a particular prefix, it will send it out and count it as one until it hits the send-path-limits which is 4 by default. Since in our route-policy, we have a permit all at the end which means every route will have a match, therefore first 4 routes in the winning order are sent out regardless which rule they're matching in the policy. There are multiple ways to fix this, the simple way is to change the limit to 16 on both vSmart as well as on the wEdges.\n\n\nStep 2.\n Configure send-path-limit 16 on vSmart\n\n\nGo to Configuration->Templates->Device Template, edit vSmart template, under the OMP config section, add one new command 'send-path-limit 16', then click Update, then Configure Devices.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3.\n Change ecmp-limit to 16 on the wEdges.\n\n\nGo to Configuration->Templates->Feature Template (tab, next to Device Tempalte), search for OMP, and edit Lab_OMP_V01, Under Basic Configuration section look for ECMP limit, change it to Global, and set to 16.Then update, Next, Configure Devices.check Confirm configuration changes on 7 Devices, then  OK.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4.\n Verification.\nSSH to R1-WE1 and do show sdwan omp route vpn 1, you should see each route (10.100.100.0/24 and 10.200.200.0/24) will have 12 paths and 3 paths from prefered DC with preference of 100, 3 paths from secondary DC with preference of 50, another 6 paths from are invalid from other BU hub devices.\n\n\n\n\ndo show ip route vrf 1; you will see 10.100.100.0/0 is leared from 1.1.10.1; 10.200.200.0/24 is learned from 1.1.20.1 whis is desired.\n\n\n\n\nNext, we need to do the same for LAB_Topo_RS2.\n\nStep 5.\n Go to Configuration->Policies->Custom Options->Centralized Policy-> Topology. Click Edit under three dots of LAB_Topo_RS1_V02.Select Route as the sequence type,we're going to add four more rules, match OMP Tag 1000 and TLOC of DC1-BU2-TLOCs accept and set preference of 100 ; match OMP Tag 1000 and TLOC of DC2-BU2-TLOCs accept and set preference of 50;  match OMP Tag 2000 and TLOC of DC2-BU2-TLOCs accept and set preference of 100 ; match OMP Tag 2000 and TLOC of DC1-BU2-TLOCs accept and set preference of 50;and we need to make sure the sequence of these rules are ahead of previous accept all rule as the order on vSmart policy does matter, it will do the lookup based upon the order, if it finds the match, it will use that rule and it won't look for subsequent rule any more. Dragging the new rule up and drop the rule in front of the accept all rule (if you follow the lab previously, the new rules should be No. 5, 6,7 and 8, match all rule should be rule No. 9), Then click Save policy and Activate. This will make the vSmart to push the policy immediately after you confirm configuring devices (this is expected as illuted earlier, creating a new policy is a best practice otherwise upating the existing policy will cause the immediate policy push. )\n\n\n\n\nStep 6.\n Verification.\nSSH to R2-WE1 and do show sdwan omp route vpn 1, you should see each route (10.100.100.0/24 and 10.200.200.0/24) will have 12 paths and 3 paths from prefered DC with preference of 100, 3 paths from secondary DC with preference of 50, another 6 paths from are invalid from other BU hub devices.\n\n\n\n\ndo show ip route vrf 1; you will see 10.100.100.0/0 is leared from 1.1.10.2; 10.200.200.0/24 is learned from 1.1.20.2 whis is desired.\n\n\n\n\nThis concludes the routing handling for the specific routes.\n\n\n3.5 Lab instructions for task Lab_Task 5 (Application Aware Routing)\n\n\nACME wants to provide best user experience for their transactional data ( we will use SSH to simulate that) which has to meet the below SLA requirement. In the mean while, ACME would like to use private 1 as the preferred link, if private 1 doesn't meet the SLA requirement, it will use private 2 when private 2 still meets the SLA. LTE link will only be used when both private 1 and private 2 go down.

You can classify an application based upon traditional 5 tuples or even applications (Deep Pakcket Inspection). There three action keyword for the seleted application. Prefer; backup and strict. The key to remember is AAR is all about SLA.\n\n\nPrefer means when the preferred color/s meets the SLA, this/these colors will be prefered. If all the preferred colors don't meet the SLA, then depends on if you have backup or strict configure, these two options are mutual exclusive.\n\n\nIf backup color is configured which means when preferred color doesn't meet SLA, first it will use all other colors meeting the SLA regardless if that color is configured as backup or not as long as the color meets the SLA, if there are multiple such colors, it will do load sharing among them. If none of the colors meeting the SLAs, it will use the configured backup color.\n\n\nIf strict is configured (note: stric and backup are mutual exclusive ), the matching traffic will be dropped when the preferred color is not configured.\n\n\nBased upon the requirements, we will do the following, first confgure LTE as last resort which means it won't come up until all other circuits are not available. Then we configure private1 as preferred color, we simply don't need to mention private2 as if private2 meets the SLA, it will be used anyway. If private2 doesn't meet SLA, as neither strict nor backup is configured, it will simply use any available tunnels.\n\n\nStep 1.\n Configure RH LTE interface as last resort circuit as the LTE will only be used when all other circuits becomes unavailable.\n\n\nGo to Configuration->Templates->Feature, search LTE, and select Lab_RH_VPN0_LTE_V01, then click Edit (three dots)\n\n\n\n\nUnder 'Tunnel' section, expand 'Advanced Options', change 'Last-Resort Circuit' settings to Device Specific and click update.Then click three dots, Edit Device Template, check Last-Resort Circuit and Update, Next and Configure Devices.

            "text": "In this section, you will help ACME on advanced routing using local and central policy. You will perform the following tasks.    ACME DC routers have already tagged all the routes originated from DC1 with BGP community of 65010:1000; all the routes originated from DC2 with BGP community of 65020:2000.  Please configure a route-policy to ensure default route (0.0.0.0/0) coming from DC to set an OMP tag of 100.  For DC1 routes, setting an OMP tag of  1000 ; for DC2 routes, setting an OMP tag of  2000 . (Lab_Task 1)    ACME wants to have a  hub & spoke topology between Remotes and DCs as well between Remotes and Regional hubs . Hub & spoke topology will scale more by reducing NO. of tunnels required on the devices. (Lab_Task 2)    ACME has categorized their branches into multiple Business Units(BUs). In the Data Center (DC) sites, the headend WAN Edges(WEs) are also categorized into multiple BUs for horizontal scaling purpose in terms of throughputs, therefore remote site only needs to build tunnels to its respective DC hub WEs.  Remote Site1 only needs to build tunnels to DC1-WE1 and DC2-WE2 ; on the contrary,  Remote Site 2 only needs to build tunnels to DC1-WE2 and DC2-WE2 .(Lab_Task 2)    Remote sites receive default route from both RH and DC,  DCs will be preferred and load shared . If RH goes down, DCs are load shared for default(Lab_Task 3)    change to  - Remote sites receive default route from both RH and DC,  DCs will be preferred and load shared. RH's default will be used as backup for DCs. (Lab_Task 3)**    Remotes sites receive more specific routes from both DCs,  routes originated from local DC are preferred , if one DC goes down, it will use the routes from another DC as backup. In another words, from remote sites perspective, previously routes tagged with 1000 will prefer DC1; routes tagged with 2000 will prefer DC2.(Lab_Task 4)    For remote sites to any other regional routes are forced to go through DC\u2019s functional hub. For  remote site1, it goes through WE1 in DC1 and DC2 ; for  remote site 2, it goes through WE2 in DC1 and DC2 .(Lab_Task 4)    Note: In these lab exercises, it's possible that there are multiple ways to achieve the requirements. The lab guide provides a detailed step by step instruction for each taks. However you're welcomed to solve it with your own solution. Just be mindful with the time.",

This is because R1-WE1 doesn't have a transport with private 2 color. If you watch the route on R2-WE1, you should notice the next hop from private 1 marked as  (Inv,U)  for the same reason where private 1 color doesn't exist on R2-WE1.  Question: Did you notice the default route is learned from 1.1.30.2 which is the Regional Hub(RH)? Do you know why?    To answer this question, we will check the route table at vSmart as all the routes are advertised by vSmart. SSH to vSmart and do  show omp route vpn 1 0.0.0.0/0 detail | t   OMP is very much like BGP when it comes down to route preference. In the order of preference, there is a origin-protocol, in this case the default route learned on RH is from Static (by design, in real deployment, probably it's going to be BGP as well); whereas the default learned from DCs is from iBGP. Origin protocol static is more preferred than iBGP.  Now, let's look at the specific routes learned from DC. Do  show sdwan omp route vpn 1 10.100.100.0/24  on vSmart.   Question: you will see 4 paths and one of the paths shows Inv,U. Hopefully you can answer why it's that. But why there are 4 paths?  Let's SSH to vSmart and do  show omp route vpn 1 10.100.100.0/24 | t .   You will see 12 ECMP routes marked as  C,R  (Chosen,Resolved). Why 12? Because we have 4 DC wEdges each with 3 transports, so total 12 paths.   The next question will be why there are only 4 paths on the remote wEdges? This is because the ECMP settings on the wEdge by default is set to 4. If you change it to 16 (currently 16, it will be increased to 128 in the future release), you will see all 12 paths.   Note: vSmart randomly selects 4 paths (or whatever the max ECMP value is set) and install on the device. In a  large deployment where multiple paths is more than 16 (before 128 paths is supported), this may pose problem.  In this exercise we purposely keep the default ECMP setting and learn how to solve this issue with centralized policy.",

We're expecting the routes which are learned from DC1-WE1 and DC2-WE1 with preference of 100. However, the output shows the routes are not changed at all, the three installed routes still learned from RH and no preference set either. Why is that?   Let's check omp route table on the vSmart, SSH to vSmart and do  show omp route | t . As you recall, the OMP routes don't have any changes either where 3 paths learned from RH marked with C,R due to routes originated from Static which are preferred over originated from iBGP. But why the outbound policy setting the routes originated from DC1-WE1 and DC2-WE1 doesn't work,  this is because outbound policy will only look for the chosen routes with C.R by default, other routes without learned from DCs as they are not chosen without C,R , so those routes are not even going through the outbound policies. There are multiple way of changing this behavior such as using inbound policy or configure send-backup path, or make every route with C.R. We're not going over all the solutions.  Let's configure an vSmart  inbound policy  to make the default routes from DCs have higher OMP preference than RH's.  Note: vSmart inbound policy may not be an ideal solution for the scenarios. It is recommended to use outbound policy only if an outbound policy can meet the requirements without additional inbound policy for its simplicity and full visibility of vSmart.",

This will make the vSmart to push the policy immediately after you confirm configuring devices (this is expected as illuted earlier, creating a new policy is a best practice otherwise upating the existing policy will cause the immediate policy push. )    Let's verify. SSH to R1-WE1 and do show sdwan omp route vpn 1, you can see 4 paths for 10.100.100.0/24, however we see 3 paths with preference of 100, 1 path doesn't have preference; and for 10.200.200.0/24, there are 4 paths however 3 paths with preference of 50, 1 path doesn't have preference. If you look at it closely you will notice that the paths picked are from the lowest system-ip.   This is caused that vSmart by default will only send 4 paths to the wEdges. When vSmart is going through the outbound policy, it takes a route from vsmart route table in the winning order (marked as C,R) and compare it with the outbound policy as long as there is a match (permit) in the policy for a particular prefix, it will send it out and count it as one until it hits the send-path-limits which is 4 by default. Since in our route-policy, we have a permit all at the end which means every route will have a match, therefore first 4 routes in the winning order are sent out regardless which rule they're matching in the policy. There are multiple ways to fix this, the simple way is to change the limit to 16 on both vSmart as well as on the wEdges.  Step 2.  Configure send-path-limit 16 on vSmart  Go to Configuration->Templates->Device Template, edit vSmart template, under the OMP config section, add one new command 'send-path-limit 16', then click Update, then Configure Devices.   Step 3.  Change ecmp-limit to 16 on the wEdges.  Go to Configuration->Templates->Feature Template (tab, next to Device Tempalte), search for OMP, and edit Lab_OMP_V01, Under Basic Configuration section look for ECMP limit, change it to Global, and set to 16.Then update, Next, Configure Devices.check Confirm configuration changes on 7 Devices, then  OK.   Step 4.  Verification.\nSSH to R1-WE1 and do show sdwan omp route vpn 1, you should see each route (10.100.100.0/24 and 10.200.200.0/24) will have 12 paths and 3 paths from prefered DC with preference of 100, 3 paths from secondary DC with preference of 50, another 6 paths from are invalid from other BU hub devices.   do show ip route vrf 1; you will see 10.100.100.0/0 is leared from 1.1.10.1; 10.200.200.0/24 is learned from 1.1.20.1 whis is desired.   Next, we need to do the same for LAB_Topo_RS2. Step 5.  Go to Configuration->Policies->Custom Options->Centralized Policy-> Topology. Click Edit under three dots of LAB_Topo_RS1_V02.Select Route as the sequence type,we're going to add four more rules, match OMP Tag 1000 and TLOC of DC1-BU2-TLOCs accept and set preference of 100 ; match OMP Tag 1000 and TLOC of DC2-BU2-TLOCs accept and set preference of 50;  match OMP Tag 2000 and TLOC of DC2-BU2-TLOCs accept and set preference of 100 ; match OMP Tag 2000 and TLOC of DC1-BU2-TLOCs accept and set preference of 50;and we need to make sure the sequence of these rules are ahead of previous accept all rule as the order on vSmart policy does matter, it will do the lookup based upon the order, if it finds the match, it will use that rule and it won't look for subsequent rule any more.

LTE link will only be used when both private 1 and private 2 go down. ACME has the following SLA requirements for their applications.

You can classify an application based upon traditional 5 tuples or even applications (Deep Pakcket Inspection). There three action keyword for the seleted application. Prefer; backup and strict. The key to remember is AAR is all about SLA.  Prefer means when the preferred color/s meets the SLA, this/these colors will be prefered. If all the preferred colors don't meet the SLA, then depends on if you have backup or strict configure, these two options are mutual exclusive.  If backup color is configured which means when preferred color doesn't meet SLA, first it will use all other colors meeting the SLA regardless if that color is configured as backup or not as long as the color meets the SLA, if there are multiple such colors, it will do load sharing among them. If none of the colors meeting the SLAs, it will use the configured backup color.  If strict is configured (note: stric and backup are mutual exclusive ), the matching traffic will be dropped when the preferred color is not configured.  Based upon the requirements, we will do the following, first confgure LTE as last resort which means it won't come up until all other circuits are not available. Then we configure private1 as preferred color, we simply don't need to mention private2 as if private2 meets the SLA, it will be used anyway. If private2 doesn't meet SLA, as neither strict nor backup is configured, it will simply use any available tunnels.  Step 1.  Configure RH LTE interface as last resort circuit as the LTE will only be used when all other circuits becomes unavailable.  Go to Configuration->Templates->Feature, search LTE, and select Lab_RH_VPN0_LTE_V01, then click Edit (three dots)   Under 'Tunnel' section, expand 'Advanced Options', change 'Last-Resort Circuit' settings to Device Specific and click update.Then click three dots, Edit Device Template, check Last-Resort Circuit and Update, Next and Configure Devices. This setting will make LTE last-resort which means the interface will go down, and no traffic go across it until all other circuits become unavailable.  Step 2.  Last-Resort verification.  SSH to RH and do show ip int brief, you will notice Gig3 is down and Tunnel3 is down as well.   Do show sdwan control connections, there is no control connections on LTE.   Do show sdwan bfd sessions, there is no IPSec tunnel over LTE either.   Step 3.  Configure SLA classes for app aware routing (AAR)  Go to Configurations->Policies->Custome Options->Centralized Policiy->Lists   select SLA Class and make sure above classes are defined properly.

You will perform the following tasks in this lab.\n\n\n\n\nAdd QoS and make sure consistent QoS policies are applied across the SD-WAN fabric.\n\n\nRegional hub has higher bandwidth on WAN circuits compare to remote sites. This bandwidth mismatch could potentially cause packet drops on remote sites. Configure the sd-wan fabric to prevent this potential issue.\n\n\nDue to the latency sensitive application requirement, a spoke to spoke tunnel is needed between remote sites. Configure the sd-wan fabric to build on-demand tunnel between remote sites.\n\n\nCloud Application (16.16.16.16) requires inspection services on all users. Configure IPSec tunnel to SIG provider for inspection services and configure the sd-wan fabric to route all traffic to this application over a IPSec tunnel.  \n\n\nACME wants to reduce the bandwidth consumption on private WAN links. Configure the sd-wan fabric to route public cloud and Internet traffic over local internet access.\n\n\nFor SaaS application, configure the sd-wan fabric to use either local DIA or RH based on application performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 1: QoS\n\n\nEnabling QoS has three main steps: classification, marking and queueing. Queueing policy is configured as Localized policy and applied on interface level. classification and marking can be enabled over Localized policy or over centralized data policy. ACME requires consistent QoS policies across sd-wan fabric, you will use centralized data policy to achieve that.\n\n\nACME uses 4-class QoS model with the following policy requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass\n\n\nApplications\n\n\nDSCP Value\n\n\nQueueing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREALTIME\n\n\nrtp,webex,zoom\n\n\nEF\n\n\n30%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSIGNALING\n\n\nrtcp,mgcp,sip\n\n\nCS3\n\n\n10%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCRITICAL\n\n\nSSH,SNMP,SMB\n\n\nAF31\n\n\n40%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDEFAULT\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n20%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep1.1: class map and applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlogin vManage \n198.18.133.200\n and access policy configuration from \nConfiguration - Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nCustom Options\n drop down on the top right and select \nLists\n under \nLocalized Policy\n\n \n  \n\n\n\n\nClick \nClass Map\n list type on the left and add \nNew Class List\n.

You should see this login page\n  \n\n\n\n\nTask 5: DIA\n\n\nThere are two options to enable DIA.\n- option 1: NAT DIA Route\n\n\n\nIn this option, a NAT route is configured under service VPN. You can direct local internet traffic from service VPN to transport VPN.\n- option 2: Centralized data policy\n  \n\n\nIn this option, a centralized policy is applied to service side traffic based on ip prefixes, a match will redirect to transport VPN. Traffic that doesnt match the policy will stay in service VPN and route over IPSec tunnel.\n\n\nIn this task, you are going to configure DIA on remote sites using option 2.       \n\n\nTask 6: CoR for SaaS\n\n\nInstead of using the DIA exit point as configured in previous task, for SaaS application box and salesforce, ACME wants to use the most optimal path. Configure the remote sites to dynamically chose local DIA or regional hub as exit point for box and salesforce based on application performance.\n  \n\n\nStep6.1 Enable Cloud OnRamp for SaaS\n\n\n\n\nlogin vManage \n198.18.133.200\n and access \nAdministration - Settings\n\n\nEdit \nCloud onRamp for SaaS\n and check \nEnabled\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nStep6.2 Add SaaS application\n\n\n\n\nAccess CoR SaaS configuration via \nConfiguration - Cloud onRamp for SaaS\n  \n\n\n\n\nFrom \nManage Cloud OnRamp for SaaS\n dropdown, select \nApplications and Policy\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect \nBox\n and \nSalesforce\n from the application list; Select \nEnabled\n for Monitoring dropdown list; Enter \n1\n for VPN; Select \nEnabled\n for Policy/Cloud SLA dropdown list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Cloud OnRamp for SaaS uses existing AAR policy, we will keep the system created policy for SaaS. Click \nSave Policy\n to proceed the policy update.\n  \n\n\nStep6.3 Add sites\n\n\nYou are going to configure remote sites as DIA site, and Regional hub as gateway site. Remote sites will monitor the QoE score for local DIA via LTE transport, and also the QoE score for gateway site.\n- Access CoR SaaS configuration via \nConfiguration - Cloud onRamp for SaaS\n\n- Click \nManage Cloud OnRamp for SaaS\n dropdown list on the upper left, and select \nGateway\n\n  \n\n- Click \nAttach Gateways\n,  select \nRH-WE1\n and move it to \nselected Sites\n. Click \nAdd interfaces to selected sites\n.\n  \n\n- In the pop up window, under \nInterface\n field select interface \nGigabitEthernet4\n from the list. This will allow gateway site sends\n\n   \n\n- Click \nManage Cloud OnRamp for SaaS\n dropdown list on the upper left, and select \nDIA Sites\n\n   \n\n- select \nAttach DIA Sites\n, select \nR1-WE1\n and \nR2-WE1\n and move it to \nselected Sites\n.     \n\n   \n  \n\n\nStep6.4 Verify CoR SaaS\n\n\nClick \nManage Cloud OnRamp for SaaS\n to verify QoE status, DIA status, exit interface on each WAN Edge for SaaS application.  \n\n   \n\n\nNote: Your output may not match the screenshot on the vQoE score and DIA Status. This is expected.\n\n- screenshot above shows both remote sites are using local DIA as exit point for box and Salesfoce SaaS application.\n- This lab doesn't have traffic impairment tool, we can't increase remote transport's latency or drop to trigger SaaS changes exit point. But if you keep checking the SaaS status, you will notice the vQoE score changes and exit interface changes.\n   \n\n\n\n\nCongratulation! You have completed the whole lab.\n\n\nBack to Top",

Add QoS and make sure consistent QoS policies are applied across the SD-WAN fabric.  Regional hub has higher bandwidth on WAN circuits compare to remote sites. This bandwidth mismatch could potentially cause packet drops on remote sites. Configure the sd-wan fabric to prevent this potential issue.  Due to the latency sensitive application requirement, a spoke to spoke tunnel is needed between remote sites. Configure the sd-wan fabric to build on-demand tunnel between remote sites.  Cloud Application (16.16.16.16) requires inspection services on all users. Configure IPSec tunnel to SIG provider for inspection services and configure the sd-wan fabric to route all traffic to this application over a IPSec tunnel.    ACME wants to reduce the bandwidth consumption on private WAN links. Configure the sd-wan fabric to route public cloud and Internet traffic over local internet access.  For SaaS application, configure the sd-wan fabric to use either local DIA or RH based on application performance.",
