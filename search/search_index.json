You will perform the following tasks. ACME DC routers have already tagged all the routes originated from DC1 with BGP community of 65010:1000; all the routes originated from DC2 with BGP community of 65020:2000. Please configure a route-policy to ensure default route (0.0.0.0/0) coming from DC to set an OMP tag of 100. For DC1 routes, setting an OMP tag of 1000 ; for DC2 routes, setting an OMP tag of 2000 . (Lab_Task 1) ACME wants to have a hub & spoke topology between Remotes and DCs as well between Remotes and Regional hubs . Hub & spoke topology will scale more by reducing NO. of tunnels required on the devices. (Lab_Task 2) ACME has categorized their branches into multiple Business Units(BUs). In the Data Center (DC) sites, the headend WAN Edges(WEs) are also categorized into multiple BUs for horizontal scaling purpose in terms of throughputs, therefore remote site only needs to build tunnels to its respective DC hub WEs. Remote Site1 only needs to build tunnels to DC1-WE1 and DC2-WE2 ; on the contrary, Remote Site 2 only needs to build tunnels to DC1-WE2 and DC2-WE2 .(Lab_Task 2) Remote sites receive default route from both RH and DC, **DCs will be preferred and load shared. RH's default will be used as backup for DCs. (Lab_Task 3) Remotes sites receive more specific routes from both DCs, routes originated from local DC are preferred , if one DC goes down, it will use the routes from another DC as backup. In another words, from remote sites perspective, previously routes tagged with 1000 will prefer DC1; routes tagged with 2000 will prefer DC2.(Lab_Task 4) For remote sites to any other regional routes are forced to go through DC\u2019s functional hub. For remote site1, it goes through WE1 in DC1 and DC2 ; for remote site 2, it goes through WE2 in DC1 and DC2 .(Lab_Task 4) Note: In these lab exercises, it's possible that there are multiple ways to achieve the requirements. The lab guide provides a detailed step by step instruction for each taks. However you're welcomed to solve it with your own solution. Just be mindful with the time. Task 1: Local Route Policy Step 1.1 Verification of the routes received on DC WEs. SSH to DC1-WE1 (repeat the same on DC1-WE2,DC2-WE1,DC2-WE2,R1-WE1 and R2-WE2 as well) and do show ip route vrf 1 and make sure 10.100.100.0/24, 10.200.200/24 as well as 0.0.0.0/0 learned via BGP. Step 1.2 Verify the BGP communities. 10.100.100.0/24 should tag with 65010:1000; 10.200.200.0/24 should tag with 65020:2000. Execute show ip bgp vpnv4 vrf 1 <prefix> (10.100.100.0/24 and 10.200.200.0/24) on DC1-WE1,WE2 and DC2-WE1,WE2. Step 1.3 set OMP tag for DC specific Routes login vManage 198.18.133.200 and access policy configuration from Configuration - Policies Click Custom Options drop down on the top right and select Route Policy under Localized Policy Click Add Route Policy to Create new Name: LAB_DCs_BGP_RP (write down this name, it will be used later) Description: LAB_DCs_BGP_RP Click +Sequence Type on the left then click +Sequence Rule , click Match, select Address , select default . Click Action , change to Accept , then select OMP tag, key in 100 , then save Match and Actions. click Sequence Rule to create following two rules: Match community-list DC1_Routes , Accept and Set OMP Tag 1000 Match community-list DC2_Routes , Accept and Set OMP Tag 2000 Click Default Action on the left panel, and change default Reject action to Accept Then click on Save Route Policy Step 1.4 Creating a Local Policy login vManage 198.18.133.200 and access policy configuration from Configuration - Policies Click on Localized Policy , then click on Add Policy Click on Next to proceed till you see Configure Route Policy ; click Add Route Policy then select Import Existing Policy ; Select LAB_DCs_BGP_RP click import Click on Next, Key in Policy Name: LAB_DCs_Local_policy Policy Description: LAB_DCs_Local_policy . Check Netflow, Application and Implicit ACL Logging . Then click on Save Policy (Feel free to click Preview before save) attach local policy to DC device templates (Lab_DC1_V01 & Lab_DC2_V01) Access template configuration from Configuration - Templates Under Device template tab, locate template Lab_DC1_V01 and select Edit under Additional Templates section, click the dropdown next to Policy and select LAB_DCs_Local_policy click update to trigger configure change Under Device template tab, locate template Lab_DC2_V01 and select Edit under Additional Templates section, click the dropdown next to Policy and select LAB_DCs_Local_policy click update to trigger configure change Step 1.5 apply the route-policy Access feature template configuration from Configuration - Templates - Feature Locate feture template Lab_DC_VPN1_BGP_V01 and select three dots then click Edit . Select Neighbor section, then click on the pencil icon under Action. Update the following: Address Family changes to Global and set to On Address Family changes to Global and set to ipv4-unicast Route Policy In changes to Global and set to On Policy Name changes to Global and set to LAB_DCs_BGP_RP (this was the name you wrote down earlier) then click on Save changes and Click on Update Then click Next, feel free to review the config changes, then click Configure Devices, then check the Confirm configuration box and click on OK. Step 1.6 Verify OMP Tags SSH to DC wEdge routers( DC1-WE1,DC1-WE2,DC2-WE1,DC2-WE2 ) and run show ip bgp vpnv4 vrf 1 <prefix> (10.100.100.0/24,10.200.200.0/24), you should see proper OMP tags are set Task 2: Hub & Spoke Topologies Step 2.1. Pre-config verifications SSH to R1-WE1 and do show sdwan omp route vpn 1 Question: Do you know why the default route learned from private2 shown as invalid and unreachable (Inv,U) ? This is because R1-WE1 doesn't have a transport with private 2 color. If you watch the route on R2-WE1, you should notice the next hop from private 1 marked as (Inv,U) for the same reason where private 1 color doesn't exist on R2-WE1. Question: Did you notice the default route is learned from 1.1.30.2 which is the Regional Hub(RH)? Do you know why? To answer this question, we will check the route table at vSmart as all the routes are advertised by vSmart. SSH to vSmart and do show omp route vpn 1 0.0.0.0/0 detail | t OMP is very much like BGP when it comes down to route preference. In the order of preference, there is a origin-protocol, in this case the default route learned on RH is from Static (by design, in real deployment, probably it's going to be BGP as well); whereas the default learned from DCs is from iBGP. Origin protocol static is more preferred than iBGP. Now, let's look at the specific routes learned from DC. Do show sdwan omp route vpn 1 10.100.100.0/24 on R1-WE1 . Question: you will see 4 paths and one of the paths shows Inv,U. Hopefully you can answer why it's that. But why there are 4 paths? Let's SSH to vSmart and do show omp route vpn 1 10.100.100.0/24 | t . You will see 12 ECMP routes marked as C,R (Chosen,Resolved). Why 12? Because we have 4 DC wEdges each with 3 transports, so total 12 paths. The next question will be why there are only 4 paths on the remote wEdges? This is because the ECMP settings on the wEdge by default is set to 4. If you change it to 16 (currently 16, it will be increased to 128 in the future release), you will see all 12 paths. Note: vSmart randomly selects 4 paths (or whatever the max ECMP value is set) and install on the device. In a large deployment where multiple paths is more than 16 (before 128 paths is supported), this may pose problem. In this exercise we purposely keep the default ECMP setting and learn how to solve this issue with centralized policy. Step 2.2. Create a topology for centralized policy login vManage 198.18.133.200 and access policy configuration from Configuration - Policies Click Custom Options drop down on the top right and select Topology under Centralized Policy Click Add Topology under Topology and select Custom Control( Route&TLOC ) You are going to create two topologies, one for each remote site. Create topology policy for Remote1 Name: LAB_Topo_RS1 Description: LAB topology for Remote Site 1 Click +Sequence Type and select Route Click +Sequence Rule , leave unchanged under Match(means match all) Click Actions and change to Accept (we'll come back and do the routes policy later). click +Sequence Type then select TLOC click +Sequence Rule , select TLOC . Under Match Conditions , selects DCs-BU1-TLOCs for TLOC List (this TLOC list has been pre-defined for you which includes all the TLOCs of DC1-WE1 and DC2-WE1 Click Actions , change Actions to Accept Click +Sequence Rule , select TLOC under Match Conditions , selects RH-TLOCs for TLOC List (this TLOC list has been pre-defined for you which includes all the TLOCs of RH) Click Actions , change Actions to Accept Then click save Control Policy. This policy effectively allows R1-WE1 to build tunnels to all the DCs-BU1 devices (DC1-WE1 and DC2-WE1) as well as RH, nothing else as the default action is reject. Follow the above steps and create another topology for Remote2 with the following settings: Name: LAB_Topo_RS2 Description: LAB topology for Remote Site 2 Click +Sequence Type then select Route Click +Sequence Rule , leave unchanged under Match(means match all), Click Actions change Actions to Accept (we'll come back and do the routes policy later). Click +Sequence Type then select TLOC click +Sequence Rule , select TLOC . Under Match Conditions , selects DCs-BU2-TLOCss for TLOC List (this TLOC list has been pre-defined for you which includes all the TLOCs of DC1-WE2 and DC2-WE2) Click Actions , change Actions to Accept Click +Sequence Rule , select TLOC under Match Conditions , selects RH-TLOCs for TLOC List (this TLOC list has been pre-defined for you which includes all the TLOCs of RH) Click Actions , change Actions to Accept Then click save Control Policy. This policy effectively allows R2-WE1 to build tunnels to all the DCs-BU1 devices (DC1-WE2 and DC2-WE2) as well as RH, nothing else as the default action is reject. Step 2.3. Apply the topology policy to Centralized Policy login vManage 198.18.133.200 and access policy configuration from Configuration - Policies Click Add Policy under Centralized Policy Click next, you will see Configure Topology and VPN membership - Click Add topology , select Import Existing Topology Click Custom Control(Route and TLOC) , select LAB_Topo_RS1 Click on Add Topology follow the above steps to add topology LAB_Topo_RS2 as well Click Next proceed to the last step for Applying Policies to Sites and VPNs Policy Name: LAB_Central_v01 Description: Task2 Topo only Click New Site List Under LAB_Topo_RS1 , under Outbound Site List , select RS1 ,then click on Add Click New Site List Under LAB_Topo_RS2 , under Outbound Site List , select RS2 ,then click on Add then click Save Policy Step 2.4. Activate the first Centralized Policy login vManage 198.18.133.200 and access policy configuration from Configuration - Policies - Centralized Policy locate policy LAB_Centeral_v01 you have created in previous step. Click ... for more option and select Activate . The policy will be pushed to vSmarts. Step 2.5. Verify the hub & spoke topology SSH to R1-WE1 & R2-WE1 do show sdwan bfd sessions , verify no bfd session between R1-WE1 and R2-WE1 Task 3: Default Route handling In this task. you will configure the central policy to prefer default route learned from DC over RH. You need to modify the Centralized policy so that the default route from DC has higher OMP preference over RH. Step 3.1. New Central Policy Make a new version of the topology policy. Note: In production network, it is always recommended to create a new version when you update your policy. So you can also change to the previous version as fallback plan. login vManage 198.18.133.200 and access policy configuration from Configuration - Policies Click Custom Options drop down on the top right and select Topology under Centralized Policy Locate policy LAB_Topo_RS1 , click ... and select Copy . - Give a name and description for the new policy - Name: LAB_Topo_RS1_V02 - Description: +Default Route handling Step 3.2. Edit the new topology policy. locate LAB_Topo_RS1_V02 and click ... select Edit you are going to add four new rules rule1: match default & originator of 1.1.10.1(DC1-WE1) then accept and set preference of 100 rule2: match default & originator of 1.1.20.1(DC2-WE1) then accept and set preference of 100 rule3: match default & site-list RH then accept rule4: match default then reject Drag & drop the newly created rules to move it ahead of previous accept all rule. Note: vSmart does the lookup based on the order, if it finds the match, it will use that rule and it won't look for subsequent rule any more. - click Save Control policy . Step 3.3. Apply the policy login vManage 198.18.133.200 and access policy configuration from Configuration - Policies locate centralized policy LAB_Central_v01 , click ... and select Edit Note: In production deployment, you always want to use the same practice of copying the current policy then apply it. Under Topology tab, select LAB_Topo_RS1 . Click ... and select Detach to remove this topology. Click Add Topology , select Import Existing Topology then select LAB_Topo_RS1_V02 , then click Import. Click on Policy Application Under LAB_Topo_RS1_V02 - Outbound Site List , click New Site List and select RS1 . click ADD , Save Policy Changes to Activate. Note: Outbound and Inbound are from vSmart perspective where outbound policy means how the routes are sent out from vSmart; inbound policy means how the routes are sent to the vSmart. Step 3.4. Verify change of default route SSH to R1-WE1 and do show sdwan omp route and check the learned TLOC for default route as well as preference. We're expecting the routes which are learned from DC1-WE1 and DC2-WE1 with preference of 100. However, the output shows the routes are not changed at all, the three installed routes still learned from RH and no preference set either. Why is that? Let's check omp route table on the vSmart, SSH to vSmart and do show omp route | t . As you recall, the OMP routes don't have any changes either where 3 paths learned from RH marked with C,R due to routes originated from Static which are preferred over originated from iBGP. But why the outbound policy setting the routes originated from DC1-WE1 and DC2-WE1 doesn't work, this is because outbound policy will only look for the chosen routes with C.R by default, other routes without learned from DCs as they are not chosen without C,R , so those routes are not even going through the outbound policies. There are multiple way of changing this behavior such as using inbound policy or configure send-backup path, or make every route with C.R. We're not going over all the solutions. Let's configure an vSmart inbound policy to make the default routes from DCs have higher OMP preference than RH's. Note: vSmart inbound policy may not be an ideal solution for the scenarios. It is recommended to use outbound policy only if an outbound policy can meet the requirements without additional inbound policy for its simplicity and full visibility of vSmart. Step 3.5. Create new topology login vManage 198.18.133.200 and access policy configuration from Configuration - Policies Click Custom Options on the upper right corner and select Topology under Centralized Policy . Click Add Topology and select Custom Control(Route&TLOC) Configure the new policy with following setting Name: default_route_from_DC Description: default_route_from_DC click +Sequence Type and select Route click +Sequence Rule click Prefix List and Site under Match Under Match Conditions , select default from Prefix List dropdown Under Match Conditions , select DCs from Site List dropdown Click Actions select Accept ; add Preference with value 50 Click Default Action and change action to Accept Click Save Control Policy Apply this new topology to the current policy. login vManage 198.18.133.200 and access policy configuration from Configuration - Policies locate LAB_Central_v01 and select Edit Click Topology tab and click Add Topology Select Import Existing Topology and select Custom Control( Route and TLOC) Policy Type then select default_route_from_DC from drop down; click Import. Click on Policy Application , click on New Site List under Inbound Site List , select DCs . Click on Add and Save Policy Changes to Activate. Note: This time is an inbound policy where inbound policy controls how the vSmart are seeing the routes. Step 3.6. verify SSH to vSmart and run show omp route vpn 1 | t , you will see the routes from DCs are C,R with preference 50 now which is expected. SSH to R1-WE1 and do show sdwan omp route vpn 1 . You will see 4 paths from DCs with preference 100. Remember the vSmart outbound policy we assign preference of 100 where the inbound policy we assign preference of 50 so that we can differentiate which policy is taking effect. Well done! You have finished the default route handling task for R1-WE1.Let's do the same policy for R2-WE1. Step 3.7. Create topology policy for Remote2 login vManage 198.18.133.200 and access policy configuration from Configuration - Policies Click Custom Options on the upper right corner and select Topology under Centralized Policy . Locate LAB_Topo_RS1_v02 click ... select copy and change Name and Description to LAB_Topo_RS2_v02 then click Copy. locate newly created LAB_Topo_RS2_v02 . click ... select Edit Select TLOC as the Sequence Type; select Rule1 and click the pencil to Edit . Note: We need to change the TLOC List from BU1 to BU2 as we'd like to use the BU2's functional hub which are DC1-WE2 and DC2-WE2 as the entry point for remote site 2(Remember remote site 2 represents the remote sites for BU2, where remote site 1 represents the remote sites for BU1). Remove DCs-BU1-TLOCs by clicking the x , then select DCs-BU2-TLOCs and click Save Match and Actions . Select Route as the Sequence Type , you need to change the originator from 1.1.10.1 to 1.1.10.2 and 1.1.20.1 to 1.1.20.2 . By doing this, default route from DC1-WE2 and DC2-WE2 will have OMP preference of 100 sent to R2-WE2 site. After Save Control Policy , access the Centralized Policy from Configuration - Policies locate LAB_Central_v01 and select Edit Under Topology tab, click Add Topology and select Import Existing Topology change Policy Type to Custom Control( Route and TLOC ) ; select LAB_Topo_RS2_V02 and Import. Select existing topology LAB_Topo_RS2 , click detach to remove it from Centralized Policy. Click Policy Application ; under LAB_Topo_RS2_V02 click New Site List and select RS2 as outbound site list. click Add, and Save Policy Changes to Activate. Once the policy has been pushed to vSmart, let's verify by SSH to R2-WE1 and run show ip route vrf 1 . Now, default route has two ECMP paths, one path for each DC. - do show sdwan omp route vpn 1 .You will see that there are 4 paths in the OMP route table, however none of them is valid. Task 4: Specific Routes handling ACME wants to prefer more specific routes originated from its DC and use the other DC as backup. In the meanwhile, for BU1 (R1-WE1), it only needs to learn the routes from BU1's Headend devices (DC1-WE1, DC2-WE1); for BU2(R2-WE1), it only needs to learn the routes from BU2's Headend devices.(DC1-WE2, DC2-WE2) The specific routes from DC1 are tagged with 1000, from DC2 already tagged with 2000 in previous task. In this section, you are going to create different policies for BU1 and BU2 sites and set different OMP preference based on OMP tag. Step4.1: Modify Topology policy for remote1 login vManage 198.18.133.200 and access policy configuration from Configuration - Policies Click Custom Options on the upper right corner and select Topology under Centralized Policy . locate topology LAB_Topo_RS1_V02 . click ... and select Edit Select Route under Sequence Type , you are going to add four more rules. rule1 Click Sequence Rule , select OMP Tag and TLOC for match condition Under Match Conditions , type 1000 in OMP Tag ; DC1-BU1-TLOCs in TLOC List Click Actions , change to Accept and set Preference of 100. Click Save Match And Actions rule2 Click Sequence Rule , select OMP Tag and TLOC for match condition Under Match Conditions , type 1000 in OMP Tag ; DC2-BU1-TLOCs in TLOC List Click Actions , change to Accept and set Preference of 50 Click Save Match And Actions rule3 Click Sequence Rule , select OMP Tag and TLOC for match condition Under Match Conditions , type 2000 in OMP Tag ; DC2-BU1-TLOCs in TLOC List Click Actions , change to Accept and set Preference of 100. Click Save Match And Actions rule4 Click Sequence Rule , select OMP Tag and TLOC for match condition Under Match Conditions , type 2000 in OMP Tag ; DC1-BU1-TLOCs in TLOC List Click Actions , change to Accept and set Preference of 50 Click Save Match And Actions Dragging and Drop to move up the newly created rules ahead of the accept all rule. (if you follow the lab previously, the new rules should be No. 5, 6,7 and 8, match all rule should be rule No. 9) Note: vSmart does the lookup based upon the order, if it finds the match, it will use that rule and it won't look for subsequent rule. click Save policy to Activate. This will make the vSmart to push the policy immediately after you confirm configuring devices This is expected, creating a new policy is a best practice otherwise updating the existing active policy will cause the immediate policy push. To verify, SSH to R1-WE1 and run show sdwan omp route vpn 1 You can see 4 paths for 10.100.100.0/24, however we see 3 paths with preference of 100, 1 path doesn't have preference; and for 10.200.200.0/24, there are 4 paths however 3 paths with preference of 50, 1 path doesn't have preference. If you look at it closely you will notice that the paths picked are from the lowest system-ip. This is caused that vSmart by default will only send 4 paths to the wEdges. When vSmart is going through the outbound policy, it takes a route from vsmart route table in the winning order (marked as C,R) and compare it with the outbound policy as long as there is a match (permit) in the policy for a particular prefix, it will send it out and count it as one until it hits the send-path-limits which is 4 by default. Since in our route-policy, we have a permit all at the end which means every route will have a match, therefore first 4 routes in the winning order are sent out regardless which rule they're matching in the policy. There are multiple ways to fix this, the simple way is to change the limit to 16 on both vSmart as well as on the wEdges. Step4.2: Configure 16 paths ECMP Configure vSmart to send 16 paths Access template configuration from Configuration - Templates Under Device template tab, locate template vSmart and select Edit under OMP config section, add configure send-path-limit 16 . Click update to update the configure. Change ecmp-limit to 16 on the wEdges. Access template configuration from Configuration - Templates Under Feature template tab, locate template Lab_OMP_V01 and select Edit Under Basic Configuration section, change ECMP to 16 as Global variable. Click update to push configuration changes. Step4.3: Verification SSH to R1-WE1 and run show sdwan omp route vpn 1 You should see each route (10.100.100.0/24 and 10.200.200.0/24) will have 12 paths and 3 paths from prefered DC with preference of 100, 3 paths from secondary DC with preference of 50, another 6 paths from are invalid from other BU hub devices. run show ip route vrf 1 You will see 10.100.100.0/0 is learned from 1.1.10.1; 10.200.200.0/24 is learned from 1.1.20.1 which is desired. Step4.4: Modify Topology policy for remote2 login vManage 198.18.133.200 and access policy configuration from Configuration - Policies Click Custom Options on the upper right corner and select Topology under Centralized Policy . locate topology LAB_Topo_RS2_V02 . click ... and select Edit Select Route under Sequence Type , you are going to add four more rules. rule1 Click Sequence Rule , select OMP Tag and TLOC for match condition Under Match Conditions , type 1000 in OMP Tag ; DC1-BU2-TLOCs in TLOC List Click Actions , change to Accept and set Preference of 100.

(if you follow the lab previously, the new rules should be No. 5, 6,7 and 8, match all rule should be rule No. 9) Note: vSmart does the lookup based upon the order, if it finds the match, it will use that rule and it won't look for subsequent rule. click Save policy to Activate. This will make the vSmart to push the policy immediately after you confirm configuring devices This is expected, creating a new policy is a best practice otherwise updating the existing active policy will cause the immediate policy push. Step4.5: Verification SSH to R2-WE1 and run show sdwan omp route vpn 1 You should see each route (10.100.100.0/24 and 10.200.200.0/24) will have 12 paths and 3 paths from prefered DC with preference of 100, 3 paths from secondary DC with preference of 50, another 6 paths from are invalid from other BU hub devices. run show ip route vrf 1 You will see 10.100.100.0/0 is leared from 1.1.10.2; 10.200.200.0/24 is learned from 1.1.20.2 whis is desired. This concludes the routing handling for the specific routes. Task 5: Application Aware Routing ACME wants to provide best user experience for their transactional data ( we will use SSH to simulate that) which has to meet the below SLA requirement. In the mean while, ACME would like to use private 1 as the preferred link, if private 1 doesn't meet the SLA requirement, it will use private 2 when private 2 still meets the SLA. LTE link will only be used when both private 1 and private 2 go down. ACME has the following SLA requirements for their applications. Application Loss(%) Lattency(msec) Jitter(msec) Transactional Data 5 50 100 Bulk-Data 10 300 100 Voice-and-Video 2 45 100 Default 25 300 100 Solutions: Application Aware Routing (AAR) is one of the differentiator between SDWAN and traditional WAN technology where you can route traffic based upon Application's SLA. You can classify an application based upon traditional 5 tuples or even applications (Deep Pakcket Inspection). There three action keyword for the seleted application. Prefer; backup and strict. The key to remember is AAR is all about SLA. Prefer means when the preferred color/s meets the SLA, this/these colors will be prefered. If all the preferred colors don't meet the SLA, then depends on if you have backup or strict configure, these two options are mutual exclusive. If backup color is configured which means when preferred color doesn't meet SLA, first it will use all other colors meeting the SLA regardless if that color is configured as backup or not as long as the color meets the SLA, if there are multiple such colors, it will do load sharing among them. If none of the colors meeting the SLAs, it will use the configured backup color. If strict is configured (note: stric and backup are mutual exclusive ), the matching traffic will be dropped when the preferred color is not configured. Based upon the requirements, we will do the following, first confgure LTE as last resort which means it won't come up until all other circuits are not available. Then we configure private1 as preferred color, we simply don't need to mention private2 as if private2 meets the SLA, it will be used anyway. If private2 doesn't meet SLA, as neither strict nor backup is configured, it will simply use any available tunnels. Step5.1: Configure RH LTE interface be used only when all other circuits are unavailable. Access template configuration from Configuration - Templates Under Feature template tab, locate template Lab_RH_VPN0_LTE_V01 and select Edit Under Tunnel section, expand Advanced Options ; change Last-Resort Circuit settings to On . Click Update to trigger configure push This setting will make LTE last-resort which means the interface will go down, and no traffic go across it until all other circuits become unavailable. Step5.2: Last-Resort verification. SSH to RH and run show ip int brief You will notice Gig3 is down and Tunnel3 is down as well. Run show sdwan control connections . Notice there is no control connections on LTE. Run show sdwan bfd sessions , and there is no IPSec tunnel over LTE either.

Let's restore private1 and private2 link by changing the device values of RH-WE1 device template, uncheck the shutdown box of GigabitEthernet1 and 2.Update->Next->Configure Devices Before we proceed to the next lab, let's do one more simulation test. login vManage 198.18.133.200 and select Monitor - Network click RH-WE1 to bring up device monitor page, and select Troubleshooting from the panel on the left select Simulate Flows tool under Traffic and use the following value for simulated flow VPN: VPN-1 Source/Interface for VPN-1: Gigabiethernet4 - ipv4 - 10.10.30.2 Source IP: 10.10.30.2 Destination IP: 10.100.100.100 (this is DC1-WE) Click on Advanced Options : Protocol: 6 (TCP) Destination Port: 22 All Paths: Checked Click Simulate you should see traffic is taking both private1 & private2. Question: In the previous AAR lab says private1 should be preferred, and we have verified that behavior earlier. Why this is taking both private1 and private2 now? This is because our Data Policy says TCP traffic can use all the colors, when you have both AAR and Data Policy configured, Data Policy will take the final decision. You have to be careful with that when designing your AAR and DP. Avoid having both configured for the same application on same sites. Note: In later sections of the lab, you will need to use LTE interface and central data policy. Please disable last-resort on LTE of RH-WE1.

You will perform the following tasks. ACME DC routers have already tagged all the routes originated from DC1 with BGP community of 65010:1000; all the routes originated from DC2 with BGP community of 65020:2000. Please configure a route-policy to ensure default route (0.0.0.0/0) coming from DC to set an OMP tag of 100. For DC1 routes, setting an OMP tag of 1000 ; for DC2 routes, setting an OMP tag of 2000 . (Lab_Task 1) ACME wants to have a hub & spoke topology between Remotes and DCs as well between Remotes and Regional hubs . Hub & spoke topology will scale more by reducing NO. of tunnels required on the devices. (Lab_Task 2) ACME has categorized their branches into multiple Business Units(BUs). In the Data Center (DC) sites, the headend WAN Edges(WEs) are also categorized into multiple BUs for horizontal scaling purpose in terms of throughputs, therefore remote site only needs to build tunnels to its respective DC hub WEs. Remote Site1 only needs to build tunnels to DC1-WE1 and DC2-WE2 ; on the contrary, Remote Site 2 only needs to build tunnels to DC1-WE2 and DC2-WE2 .(Lab_Task 2) Remote sites receive default route from both RH and DC, **DCs will be preferred and load shared. RH's default will be used as backup for DCs. (Lab_Task 3) Remotes sites receive more specific routes from both DCs, routes originated from local DC are preferred , if one DC goes down, it will use the routes from another DC as backup. In another words, from remote sites perspective, previously routes tagged with 1000 will prefer DC1; routes tagged with 2000 will prefer DC2.(Lab_Task 4) For remote sites to any other regional routes are forced to go through DC\u2019s functional hub.

If you watch the route on R2-WE1, you should notice the next hop from private 1 marked as (Inv,U) for the same reason where private 1 color doesn't exist on R2-WE1. Question: Did you notice the default route is learned from 1.1.30.2 which is the Regional Hub(RH)? Do you know why?

SSH to vSmart and do show omp route vpn 1 0.0.0.0/0 detail | t OMP is very much like BGP when it comes down to route preference. In the order of preference, there is a origin-protocol, in this case the default route learned on RH is from Static (by design, in real deployment, probably it's going to be BGP as well); whereas the default learned from DCs is from iBGP.

Let's SSH to vSmart and do show omp route vpn 1 10.100.100.0/24 | t . You will see 12 ECMP routes marked as C,R (Chosen,Resolved). Why 12? Because we have 4 DC wEdges each with 3 transports, so total 12 paths. The next question will be why there are only 4 paths on the remote wEdges? This is because the ECMP settings on the wEdge by default is set to 4. If you change it to 16 (currently 16, it will be increased to 128 in the future release), you will see all 12 paths. Note: vSmart randomly selects 4 paths (or whatever the max ECMP value is set) and install on the device. In a large deployment where multiple paths is more than 16 (before 128 paths is supported), this may pose problem.

Let's check omp route table on the vSmart, SSH to vSmart and do show omp route | t . As you recall, the OMP routes don't have any changes either where 3 paths learned from RH marked with C,R due to routes originated from Static which are preferred over originated from iBGP. But why the outbound policy setting the routes originated from DC1-WE1 and DC2-WE1 doesn't work, this is because outbound policy will only look for the chosen routes with C.R by default, other routes without learned from DCs as they are not chosen without C,R , so those routes are not even going through the outbound policies. There are multiple way of changing this behavior such as using inbound policy or configure send-backup path, or make every route with C.R. We're not going over all the solutions. Let's configure an vSmart inbound policy to make the default routes from DCs have higher OMP preference than RH's. Note: vSmart inbound policy may not be an ideal solution for the scenarios.

You will perform the following tasks in this lab. Add QoS and make sure consistent QoS policies are applied across the SD-WAN fabric. Regional hub has higher bandwidth on WAN circuits compare to remote sites. This bandwidth mismatch could potentially cause packet drops on remote sites. Configure the sd-wan fabric to prevent this potential issue. Due to the latency sensitive application requirement, a spoke to spoke tunnel is needed between remote sites. Configure the sd-wan fabric to build on-demand tunnel between remote sites. Cloud Application (16.16.16.16) requires inspection services on all users. Configure IPSec tunnel to SIG provider for inspection services and configure the sd-wan fabric to route all traffic to this application over a IPSec tunnel. ACME wants to reduce the bandwidth consumption on private WAN links. Configure the sd-wan fabric to route public cloud and Internet traffic over local internet access. For SaaS application, configure the sd-wan fabric to use either local DIA or RH based on application performance. Task 1: QoS Enabling QoS has three main steps: classification, marking and queueing. Queueing policy is configured as Localized policy and applied on interface level. classification and marking can be enabled over Localized policy or over centralized data policy. ACME requires consistent QoS policies across sd-wan fabric, you will use centralized data policy to achieve that. ACME uses 4-class QoS model with the following policy requirements. Class Applications DSCP Value Queueing REALTIME Real Time Protocol,webex,zoom 46 30% SIGNALING rtcp,mgcp,sip 24 10% CRITICAL SSH,SNMP,SMB 26 40% DEFAULT 0 20% Step1.1: class map and applications login vManage 198.18.133.200 and access policy configuration from Configuration - Policies Click Custom Options drop down on the top right and select Lists under Localized Policy Click Class Map list type on the left and add New Class List . In the pop up window enter REALTIME in Class filed, and select 0 from Queue dropdown. After save REALTIME class, add following three classes. class: SIGNALING Queue: 1 class: CRITICAL Queue: 3 class: DEFAULT Queue: 2 Click Custom Options drop down on the top right and select Lists under Centralized Policy Click Application list type on the left and add New Application List . In the application configure window enter REALTIME in Application List Name, and select \" RTP(Real Time Protocol) , WebEX , Zoom \" from Application drop list. After same \"REALTIME\" Application, add following two Applications Application List Name: SIGNALING Application: Real Time Control Protocol, Media Gateway Control Protocol, Session Initiation Protocol Application List Name: CRITICAL Application: Secure Shell, SImple Network Management Protocol, SMB Step1.2: Central Data Policy for classification login vManage 198.18.133.200 and access policy configuration from Configuration - Policies Click Custom Options drop down on the top right and select Traffic Policy under Centralized Policy Select Traffic Data and select Create New from Add Policy drop list Click +Sequence Type and select QoS for new data policy type Add +Sequence Rule to match on Application/Application Family List ; Action Accept and assign to Forwarding Class Configure the data policy to match on application list, assign to forwarding class and DSCP value as show below. After Save Data Policy , go back to the Centralized Policy configuration and edit central policy LAB_Central_V01 Click Traffic Rules tab on the top then click Traffic Data and select Import Existing to add QoS data policy Lab_QoS_v01 Click Policy Application tab on the top then click Traffic Data to assign the qos data policy. To have consistent QoS policy for the fabric, We will apply the QoS policy to all sites and all VPNs on service side as below screenshot. Click Add and Save Policy Changes then Active the updated central policy. Step1.3: Local QoS queuing policy login vManage 198.18.133.200 and access policy configuration from Configuration - Policies Click Custom Options drop down on the top right and select forwarding Class/QoS under Localized Policy Select QoS Map and select Add QoS Map to create new queuing policy Lab_QoS_Map_v01 Click Add Queue to add policy for SIGNALING class as show below. Click Add Queue to add policy for CRITICAL class as show below Click Add Queue to add policy for DEFAULT class as show below The QoS queuing policy will look similar to screenshot below. After queuing policy is created, we create localized policy that includes the queueing policy. Note: To save time, We will only create local policy for remote sites in this lab. Click Localized Policy tab and Add Policy Click Next move to configure Forwarding Classes/QoS Click Add QoS Map drop down and select import existing. Search Lab_QoS_Map_v01 and Import. Click next to pass ACL and route policy config. On Policy Overview, give a nme for the local policy and check Application at the bottom from Policy Settings. Step1.4: Apply QoS queuing policy Applying QoS queuing policy is two step process, first you need to associate the localized policy to the device template, and next you need reference the queueing policy-map on transport interface. Access template configuration from Configuration - Templates Under Device template tab, locate template Lab_R1_V01 and select Edit Associate Lab_Remote_VPN1_V01 localized policy to the template as show below Click Update to push the new localized policy configuration. Repeat the above steps for template Lab_R2_V01 Now you have the localized policy associated with device template for both remotes. Next you need reference the queueing policy on transport interfaces. Access template configuration from Configuration - Templates Under Feature template tab, locate template Lab_Remote_VPN0_Private1_v01 and select Edit Under ACL/QOS section, hardcode Lab_QoS_Map_v01 for QoS Map field. click update to push configuration change. Repeat the above steps to update Lab_Remote_VPN0_Private2_V01 and Lab_Remote_VPN0_LTE_V01 feature templates. After queuing policy is applied on both transport interfaces, you can verify the QoS policy from CLI using command show policy-map interface R2-WE1#show policy-map interface GigabitEthernet 2 GigabitEthernet2 Service-policy output: Lab_QoS_Map_v01 queue stats for all priority classes: Queueing priority level 1 queue limit 512 packets (queue depth/total drops/no-buffer drops) 0/0/0 (pkts output/bytes output) 22647/6060238 Class-map: Queue0 (match-any) 22647 packets, 6060238 bytes 30 second offered rate 15000 bps, drop rate 0000 bps Match: qos-group 0 police: rate 30 % rate 300000000 bps, burst 9375000 bytes conformed 22647 packets, 6060238 bytes; actions: transmit exceeded 0 packets, 0 bytes; actions: drop conformed 15000 bps, exceeded 0000 bps Priority: Strict, b/w exceed drops: 0 Priority Level: 1 Class-map: Queue1 (match-any) 0 packets, 0 bytes 30 second offered rate 0000 bps, drop rate 0000 bps Match: qos-group 1 Queueing queue limit 1041 packets (queue depth/total drops/no-buffer drops) 0/0/0 (pkts output/bytes output) 0/0 bandwidth remaining ratio 10 Class-map: Queue3 (match-any) 10268 packets, 1197729 bytes 30 second offered rate 0000 bps, drop rate 0000 bps Match: qos-group 3 Queueing queue limit 1041 packets (queue depth/total drops/no-buffer drops) 0/0/0 (pkts output/bytes output) 10268/1197729 bandwidth remaining ratio 40 Class-map: class-default (match-any) 15 packets, 1609 bytes 30 second offered rate 0000 bps, drop rate 0000 bps Match: any Queueing queue limit 1041 packets (queue depth/total drops/no-buffer drops) 0/0/0 (pkts output/bytes output) 15/1609 bandwidth remaining ratio 20 Exp-weight-constant: 9 (1/512) Mean queue depth: 0 packets class Transmitted Random drop Tail drop Minimum Maximum Mark pkts/bytes pkts/bytes pkts/bytes thresh thresh prob 0 1/349 0/0 0/0 260 520 1/10 1 0/0 0/0 0/0 292 520 1/10 2 0/0 0/0 0/0 325 520 1/10 3 0/0 0/0 0/0 357 520 1/10 4 0/0 0/0 0/0 390 520 1/10 5 0/0 0/0 0/0 422 520 1/10 6 14/1260 0/0 0/0 455 520 1/10 7 0/0 0/0 0/0 487 520 1/10 Task 2: per-tunnel QoS In this section, you will configure the RH WAN edge router ( RH-WE1 ) to shape tunnel traffic to each remote. This per-tunnel QoS will make sure RH cannot send excessive traffic to remotes and overrun it. Step2.1: Configure QoS policy on RH In taks 1, you have configured QoS policy on remote sites. Follow the same steps to configure QoS policy on RH RH-WE1 . login vManage 198.18.133.200 and access policy configuration from Configuration - Policies - Localized Policy Copy polocy LAB_Remote_Local_v01 and name new policy LAB_RH_Local_v01 .

Dynamic on-demand tunnel offers the benefits of having direct spoke to spoke tunnel while keep the low CPU and memory usage on WAN Edge. To improve latency of traffic between remotes, configure dynamic on-demand tunnel between remote1 and remote2. Step3.1: Modify central control policy In Lab1 you have created hub and spoke topology for both remote sites. In order to create dynamic on-demand tunnel between remotes, first you need modify the topology policy to include a tloc-action backup action. login vManage 198.18.133.200 and access policy configuration from Configuration - Policies Click Custom Options drop down on the top right and select Topology under Centralized Policy Highlight topology policy LAB_Topo_RS1 and select Edit Click TLOC from Sequence Type on the left Click Sequence Rule to add a new rule; configure the rule to match on site list All-Remotes , Actions Accept .

Step4.2 : verify SIG tunnel VNC login R1-VM1 and R2-VM1 with credential viptela verify that you can ping 16.16.16.16 from the VM now try access 16.16.16.16 from browser. You should see this login page Task 5: DIA There are two options to enable DIA. option 1: NAT DIA Route In this option, a NAT route is configured under service VPN. You can direct local internet traffic from service VPN to transport VPN. option 2: Centralized data policy In this option, a centralized policy is applied to service side traffic based on ip prefixes, a match will redirect to transport VPN. Traffic that doesnt match the policy will stay in service VPN and route over IPSec tunnel. In this task, you are going to configure DIA on remote sites using option 2. Task 6: CoR for SaaS Instead of using the DIA exit point as configured in previous task, for SaaS application box and salesforce, ACME wants to use the most optimal path. Configure the remote sites to dynamically chose local DIA or regional hub as exit point for box and salesforce based on application performance. Step6.1 Enable Cloud OnRamp for SaaS login vManage 198.18.133.200 and access Administration - Settings Edit Cloud onRamp for SaaS and check Enabled Step6.2 Add SaaS application Access CoR SaaS configuration via Configuration - Cloud onRamp for SaaS From Manage Cloud OnRamp for SaaS dropdown, select Applications and Policy Select Box and Salesforce from the application list; Select Enabled for Monitoring dropdown list; Enter 1 for VPN; Select Enabled for Policy/Cloud SLA dropdown list.

You will perform the following tasks in this lab. Add QoS and make sure consistent QoS policies are applied across the SD-WAN fabric. Regional hub has higher bandwidth on WAN circuits compare to remote sites. This bandwidth mismatch could potentially cause packet drops on remote sites. Configure the sd-wan fabric to prevent this potential issue. Due to the latency sensitive application requirement, a spoke to spoke tunnel is needed between remote sites. Configure the sd-wan fabric to build on-demand tunnel between remote sites. Cloud Application (16.16.16.16) requires inspection services on all users. Configure IPSec tunnel to SIG provider for inspection services and configure the sd-wan fabric to route all traffic to this application over a IPSec tunnel. ACME wants to reduce the bandwidth consumption on private WAN links. Configure the sd-wan fabric to route public cloud and Internet traffic over local internet access. For SaaS application, configure the sd-wan fabric to use either local DIA or RH based on application performance.","title":"Lab 3: Performance Optimization"},{"location":"lab3/#task-1-qos","text":"Enabling QoS has three main steps: classification, marking and queueing.
